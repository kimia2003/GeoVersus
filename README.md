# GeoVersus

##  About

This project is a competitive reimagining of Geoguessr, in which an image is provided to players and each must guess the location of the image. The player who guesses closest to the actual image location wins.

While this project set out to achieve something big, it unfortunately did not reach completion. Due to time mismanagement and failure to determine responsibilities in a concise way, this project does not have a game implementation and lacks a detailed front-end styling.

Nonetheless, our team gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript, React, full stack engineering, and how APIs are used in this kind of endeavor. Going forward, each of us intends to use this knowledge to bring forward higher quality work.
